# Assignment 2: Github

This assignment has three parts:

  - First, you'll clone a repository from the Github account of a news organizaton of your choice (some options below). Even if you don't understand it, look through the code! Try to understand its journalistic application. Just explore a bit.

  - Second, you'll write a quick summary of the repository you downloaded: what it does, why you think it's interesting, any questions or thoughts you have about it, etc. This can be short — 200-300 words — and should be written in text editor (not a Word doc).

  - Finally, create a repository under your Github account, add the file to it, and check it in. The file should be called `github_assignment.txt`. You can either create one repository to hold all of your class assignments or create a repository just for this assignment. Up to you.

The goal is to make sure you can perform the basic Github tasks we discussed in class. If you need a refresher, I'd recommend you consult the guide [here](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/notes/git_basics.md).

This assignment is due at the beginning of class next **Wednesday, Sept. 20.**
