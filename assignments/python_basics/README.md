Python basics
==============

As we work through the basics of Python in class, we'll also ask you to complete several corresponding assignments on Codecademy designed to reinforce basic syntax of the language.

The best way to turn in this assignment will be to create a new folder in the Github repository you're using for your assignments (or create a new repository). For each section you complete, take a screenshot of the [Python lesson index page](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) showing that each section has been completed, like this:

Put that image in the folder and check it in.
