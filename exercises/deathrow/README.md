Death Row scraper
================

The objective here is for you to work through this â€” in groups or as a class. The goal is to get to the same place we were at with the 911 scraper: to simply print out the information in the table, without the HTML coding around it.

This isn't an assignment, per se, but by the time class is done you should all be able to contribute to a discussion Friday about the remaining code needed to complete the scraper and how it works. You should also all be able to run the final scraper on your own machines!

Tips
----

  - The code we started with is in this directory as `deathrow.py`. A good place to start would be pulling it down to your local machines somehow so you have a place to start.
  - Log into your virtual environments (unless your name is Madeline) to be sure you have access to the libraries you need. That's the command `workon dataj`.
  - Finally, use the [911_simple.py scraper](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/examples/911_simple.py) as your guide.

Extra credit
------------

Well, not really. But if you finish early, I'd encourage you to start thinking about how you can save the output as a CSV. [Here's an example](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/examples/jail_scraper.py) from a scraper last semester of how that could work ...

Wrapping up

We'll discuss this on Friday. Good luck!
